User shares are decreased in this function, but the total number of shares in each strategy remains the same. The total number of shares is decremented in the 'completeQueuedWithdrawal' function instead, which is where the funds are actually sent to the user through use of the strategies' 'withdrawal' function. This ensures that the value per share reported by each strategy will remain consistent, and that the shares will continue to accrue gains during the enforced withdrawal waiting period.Strategies are removed from `stakerStrategyList` by swapping the last entry with the entry to be removed, then popping off the last entry in `stakerStrategyList`.

The first condition is because slashing of queued withdrawals cannot be guaranteed for Beacon Chain ETH (since we cannot trigger a withdrawal from the beacon chain through a smart contract) and the second condition is because shares in the enshrined 'beaconChainETH' strategy technically represent non-fungible positions (deposits to the Beacon Chain, each pointed at a specific EigenPod).","params":{"shares":"The amount of shares to withdraw from each of the respective Strategies in the `strategies` array","strategies":"The Strategies to withdraw from","strategyIndexes":"is a list of the indices in `stakerStrategyList[msg.sender]` that correspond to the strategies for which `msg.sender` is withdrawing 100% of their shares","undelegateIfPossible":"If this param is marked as 'true' *and the withdrawal will result in `msg.sender` having no shares in any Strategy,* then this function will also make an internal call to `undelegate(msg.sender)` to undelegate the `msg.sender`.","withdrawer":"The address that can complete the withdrawal and will receive any withdrawn funds or shares upon completing the withdrawal"},"returns":{"_0":"The 'withdrawalRoot' of the newly created Queued Withdrawal"}},"recordOvercommittedBeaconChainETH(address,uint256,uint256)":{"details":"Only callable by EigenPodManager.","params":{"amount":"is the amount to decrement the slashedAddress's beaconChainETHStrategy shares","beaconChainETHStrategyIndex":"is the index of the beaconChainETHStrategy in case it must be removed,","overcommittedPodOwner":"is the pod owner to be slashed"}},"removeStrategiesFromDepositWhitelist(address[])":{"params":{"strategiesToRemoveFromWhitelist":"Strategies that will be removed to the `strategyIsWhitelistedForDeposit` mapping (if they are in it)"}},"slashQueuedWithdrawal(address,(address[],uint256[],address,(address,uint96),uint32,address),address[],uint256[])":{"params":{"indicesToSkip":"Optional input parameter -- indices in the `strategies` array to skip (i.e. not call the 'withdraw' function on).
